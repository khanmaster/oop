## Inheritance 
## Abstraction
## Encapsulation
## Polymorphism

### abstraction
```bash
when using methods in our code

def bark(self):
    return "woof"

print(fido.bark())

```

        super.init() # this refers to parent/base class
snake(Animal)

Making variable or even methods private to hide various aspects of the class form a user

def __sleep():
